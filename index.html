<a id="description" class="anchor" href="#description" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Description</h2>

<p><em>Kwm</em> started as a simple project to get true focus-follows-mouse support on OSX through event tapping.<br>
It is now a tiling window manager that represents windows as the leaves of a binary tree.</p>

<p><em>Kwm</em> runs a local daemon to read messages and trigger functions.<br>
<em>Kwmc</em> can be used to write to <em>Kwm</em>'s socket, and the included hotkeys.cpp uses this program to define<br>
a mapping between keys and these functions. The config file ".kwmrc" also uses <em>Kwmc</em> to apply initial<br>
settings upon startup. Because of this, <em>Kwmc</em> needs to be placed in your path to ensure that everything<br>
works as expected. For information, check the readme located within the <em>kwmc</em> folder.  </p>

<p><em>Kwm</em> uses the event taps API (Quartz Event Services) to observe, filter and alter user input events prior<br>
to their delivery to a foreground application.</p>

<p>This allows for functionality such as focus-follows-mouse, remapping keys, and most importantly global hotkeys<br>
for interacting with <em>Kwm</em>, and so hotkeys.cpp can and should be customized by the user.<br>
The user may use an external program for running a specific command on keypress instead.</p>

<p>Both autofocus and autoraise is available, however autofocus only redirects key input to the window below the cursor,
the menubar is not accessible. By default <em>Kwm</em> is set to use autoraise as it is meant to be used alongside
the tiling functionality, and so windows should not overlap unless a window is specifically made floating.  </p>

<p><em>Multiple monitor support (in progress):</em><br>
There are two supported ways to move a window between monitors.<br>
The first one is by using <code>kwmc screen -m prev|next|id</code>.<br>
The other option is to make the window floating and manually move it with the mouse, then un-float it.<br>
Moving a window directly with the mouse WILL BREAK the window-trees of both monitors.  </p>

<p>The first time a monitor is connected, the user may have to click several times on the screen for it to register.<br>
After this step, moving the mouse to a different monitor should activate the monitor automatically.  </p>

<p><em>Kwm</em> requires access to osx accessibility.  Creating a certificate and codesigning the binary works as well.<br>
Tested on Osx El Capitan (10.11.1 / 10.11.2).</p>

<h2>
<a id="build" class="anchor" href="#build" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Build:</h2>

<p>To compile and run <em>Kwm</em>, simply run</p>

<pre><code>  make
  ./bin/kwm
</code></pre>

<p>Because there is no app bundle, <em>Kwm</em> has to be started from a terminal.</p>

<p>By default, debug prints are enabled, and these can be turned off by runnning</p>

<pre><code>  make install
</code></pre>

<p>In addition to this, for <em>Kwm</em> to work properly, the user also has to place <em>Kwmc</em> in their path.<br>
Simply move/symlink the <code>.bin/kwmc</code> binary to your path.</p>

<p>If <em>Kwm</em> is added to the path, a launcher script is necessary because it tries to load hotkeys.so from<br>
the executables working-directory.</p>

<p>Example launcher script to be placed in the path instead of the <em>Kwm</em> binary.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
pushd /path/to/kwm
./kwm
popd
</code></pre>

<p>The reason for this is that hotkeys.cpp can edited and rebuild separately, and <em>Kwm</em> will reload this<br>
library without having to be restarted and so hotkeys can be edited live.<br>
If changes have been made to hotkeys.cpp, run <code>make</code> again to recompile this file separately.  </p>

<h2>
<a id="configuration" class="anchor" href="#configuration" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Configuration:</h2>

<p>The default configuration file is <code>$HOME/.kwmrc</code> and is a script that contains <em>Kwmc</em> commands<br>
to be executed when <em>Kwm</em> starts. This file can be used to blacklist applications and specify<br>
other settings, as well as run any command not restricted to <em>Kwmc</em>.  </p>

<p>A sample config can be found within the <a href="examples">examples</a> directory.</p>

<h2>
<a id="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage:</h2>

<p>When <em>Kwm</em> starts, it will automatically tile the windows of the current space, using binary space partitioning.<br>
This will also happen once for any other space the user might switch to.</p>

<p>When <em>Kwm</em> detects a new window, it inserts it into a window tree at the specified point using the split-mode specified.<br>
When a window is closed, it will be removed from the window tree and the tree will be rebalanced.</p>

<p>By default, the insertion point is the focused window, but the user can mark a temporary insertion point to be
used instead for the next insertion.</p>

<p>There are 3 types of split-modes available, these are optimal (width/height ratio), vertical and horizontal.<br>
The default split-mode is set to optimal (width/height ratio).</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>            a                       a                       a
           / \         --&gt;         / \         --&gt;         / \    
          1   2                   1   b                   1   b
                                     / \                     / \
                                    2   3                   c   3
                                                           / \
                                                          2   4

<p><em>Kwm</em> mainly consists of three panes so to speak. The main pane being the entire screen.<br>
After at least 1 window insertion has occurred, the screen will consist of either a left and right pane,<br>
or an upper and lower pane.</p>

<p>The width of the left/right pane can be changed, as well as the height of the upper/lower pane.<br>
Currently these cannot occur simultaneously, and the type of panes created is decided by the main pane split-mode.</p>

<p>If the main pane is split using vertical mode, a left and right pane is created.<br>
If the main pane is split using horizontal mode, an upper and lower pane is created.  </p>
